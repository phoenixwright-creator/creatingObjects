Exercise 2 : 
Use __proto__ to assign prototypes in a way that any property lookup will follow the path: pockets → bed → table → head. For instance, pockets.pen should be 3 (found in table), and bed.glasses should be 1 (found in head).
Answer the question: is it faster to get glasses as pockets.glasses or head.glasses? Benchmark if needed.

let head = {
    glasses: 1
  };
  
  let table = {
    pen: 3,
    __proto__ : head
  };
  
  let bed = {
    sheet: 1,
    pillow: 2,
    __proto__ : table
  };
  
  let pockets = {
    money: 2000,
    __proto__ : bed
  };

  console.log(pockets.pen);
  console.log(bed.glasses);


// Exercise 3 :
//We have two hamsters: speedy and lazy inheriting from the general hamster object.
//When we feed one of them, the other one is also full. Why? How can we fix it?

  let hamster = {
    stomach: [],
  
    eat(food) {
      this.stomach.push(food);
    }
  };
  
  let speedy = {
    __proto__: hamster,
    stomach : []
  };
  
  let lazy = {
    __proto__: hamster,
    stomach : []
  };
  
  // This one found the food
  speedy.eat("apple");
  console.log( speedy.stomach ); // apple
  
  // This one also has it, why? fix please.
  console.log( lazy.stomach ); // apple
